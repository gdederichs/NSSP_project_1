# Read Me : Neural Processing of Emotional Music 	


## Files

The jupyter Notebook must be run in NeuroDeskApp and requires the dataset ds000171 containing the fMRI and structural MRI of the subject sub-control01 to be placed in the `data` folder.
The repository contains the source files `GLM.py`, `preprocessed.py` and `utils.py`. The preprocessing, GLM and PCA are done in the notebook `results.ipynb`. The outputs are saved in `data/derivatives`. There is some additional function we couldn't get to make work in `additional_preprocessing.ipynp`

## How to run
The notebook `results.ipynb` with access to the source files run on NeuroDeskApp on the EPFL VM contains all the relevent code.
